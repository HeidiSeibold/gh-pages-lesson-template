```{r knitr_init, echo = FALSE, cache = FALSE}
library(knitr)

## Global options
options(max.print = "75")
opts_chunk$set(cache = TRUE,
               prompt = FALSE,
               tidy = TRUE,
               comment = "> #",
               message = FALSE,
               warning = FALSE)
opts_knit$set(width = 75)
```

## Committing Locally
If you installed R libraries with RStudio server, closing it after would lose your installations. When you login back in again, your installations will not be there anymore. To avoid this, you should open up a new terminal and commit your changes locally, as illustrated below.
```{r commit-locally, eval = FALSE}
docker commit -m "built megahit" fa1bf23148a5 megahit
```

## Sorry this tutorial is still in development. The rest of this part will be available soon.
